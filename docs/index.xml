      <description>R is not a fast language. But we can make it work extremely effectively if we know how. This tutorial covers a number of techniques we can use to parallelize and speed up our code, in addition to a couple other useful tricks we can use in our research. A lot of the material is borrowed from Hadley Wickham&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Advanced R&amp;rdquo; book.
In particular, this workshop combines a review of basic R syntax (making sure everyone is up to speed) with more advanced R concepts.</description>

      <description>The absolute basics We’re going to start with the absolute fundamentals and work up from there. Unlike most regular courses, we’ll try to go in-depth into performance-related stuff as we go (keep the more advanced people interested that way…).
The most basic use of R is as a simple calculator:
5 + 4 ## [1] 9 1 - 3 ## [1] -2 4 * -2 ## [1] -8 5 / 6 ## [1] 0.</description>
